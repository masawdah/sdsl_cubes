# SDSL - Data Cubes

Data cubes are a method for storing low- or high-dimensional data in a structured format that enables efficient querying, analysis, and visualization. There are packages that support reading, writing, and manipulating data cubes, such as [rstar](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/index.html) in R and [xvec](https://xvec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) in Python.
