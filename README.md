# SDSL - Data Cubes

Data cubes are a method for storing low- or high-dimensional data in a structured format that enables efficient querying, analysis, and visualization. There are packages that support reading data cubes, such as rstar in R(https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/index.html) and xvec (https://xvec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) in Python.
